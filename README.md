# OffWorkYet?

> A tiny website for two tired people who just want to go home.

---

## What is this?

**OffWorkYet** is a minimal web page for couples (or coworkers) who want to sync their off-work status  
**without sending messages, calling, or interrupting meetings**.

Because sometimes:
- you're busy,
- they're busy,
- and everyone is pretending to work.

So instead of asking:

> “你几点下班？”

You just open a page and quietly understand everything.

## How it works

- Each person updates:
  - their **current status** (🐟 / 🔥 / 🚽 / 💀)
  - their **earliest possible off-work time**
- The other person checks the page
- Decisions are made:
  - keep slacking
  - wait a bit
  - or accept fate

No notifications.  
No chat.  
No pressure.

## Status Examples

- 🐟 摸鱼中 (Definitely not working)
- 🐕‍🦺 忙成狗 (Please don’t talk to me)
- 🔥 会议地狱 (Send help)
- 🚽 拉屎中 (Busy but not really)
- 🕊️ 即将解放 (Hope detected)
- 💀 今晚无了 (Go home alone)

---

## Tech Stack

- Pure Frontend (HTML + Tailwind CSS)
- Supabase (Free tier, no backend server)
- GitHub Pages deployment
- No build step
- No login
- No tracking
- No ambition

---

## Why?

Because love should be:
- asynchronous
- low-interruption
- and slightly sarcastic

---

## Disclaimer

This project:
- will not make you leave work earlier
- will not fix overtime culture
- **might reduce one unnecessary message per day**

Which is already a win.
